The blockchain is like a linked list. I use the list to represent it.

1, define each Block class to contain index, timestamp, data, current hash and previous hash.
2, the hash is calculated by the the index, timestamp, data and previous hash of the current Block
3, use append function of the list to acheieve the linking function of the block chain
4, define a next_block function to travese the block chain

time complexity: O(1), because getting index increment, new time stamp, loading data and previous hash
and calulating new hash information are all O(1).
space complexity: O(n), becuase the size of linked list is linearly affected by the number of blocks
