get function: retrieve item from provided key. Return -1 if nonexistent
1, if the key is in self.dic, change the appearing order of this key.
2, remove the key from the 'self.used'
3, append the key into the 'self.used'
4, return the value of the key in the self.dict, otherwise -1

time complexity: O(1), because getting values given the keys in a dictionary is O(1)
space complexity: O(n)

set function:Set the value if the key is not present in the cache. If the cache is at capacity remove the oldest item.
1, if capacity is enough, directly add the key value pair into the dictionary
2, otherwise, pop the oldest item form the self.used
3, then add the key value pair into the self.dic and self.used

time complexity: O(1); space complexity: O(n)
