time complexity: O(n * m) space complexity: O(n * m)

N denotes the number of inputs, while m denotes the average length of inputs
Because this trie will store and search all the inputs based on their character, the time 
complexity and space complexity are related to both n and m

Idea: 

Each TrieNode is composed of is_word and the children dictionary.
In insertion, we split the word into characters and traverse the trie via checking characters in each
TrieNode.
In find_suffix function, we find the TrieNode of the prefix and then save all the combination of characters
if they hits the is_word.
