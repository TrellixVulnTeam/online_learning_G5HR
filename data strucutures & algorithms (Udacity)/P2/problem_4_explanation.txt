time complexity is O(n); space complexity is O(1) due to in-place computation

if you can get the function to put the 0s and 2s in the correct positions, 
this will aotumatically cause the 1s to be in the correct positions as well.

Idea:
1, Set up three pointer, head, end and current
2, Traverse the whole array: if the current value is 0, switch it to the index head, and then move the head
3, If the current value is 2, switch it to the index end, and then move the end and current
4, If the current value is 1, move the current
