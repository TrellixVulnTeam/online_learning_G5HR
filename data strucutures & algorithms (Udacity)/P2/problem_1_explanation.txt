Time complexity is O(log n)ï¼› space complexity is O(log n) due to the binary search nature

1, recursion:

1) base case: if n*n is smaller than the target number and n+1 * n+1 is greater than the target number,
return the n

2) if not, then use binary search to check for new n, which is at mid point between the 1 and the target
number, because we know n must be between 1 and the target number
